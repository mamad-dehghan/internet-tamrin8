# Difference between javaScript and C language:

## Variables:
In C, variables must be declared with a specific data type, while in JavaScript variables are declared using 'var', 'let', or 'const' and their data type is inferred.

## Functions:
In C, functions are defined with a return type, function name, and arguments list, while in JavaScript functions are defined using the 'function' keyword and do not require a return type or argument types.

## Arrays:
In C, arrays are declared with a fixed size and are accessed using an index, while in JavaScript arrays can grow or shrink dynamically and elements can be accessed using either an index or key.

## Control flow:
C uses curly braces to define blocks of code for control flow statements like if-else, while loops, and for loops, while JavaScript uses curly braces as well but also supports more concise syntax like arrow functions, ternary operators, and the "for...of" loop.

## Object-oriented programming:
C does not have native support for object-oriented programming and requires manual struct definitions, while JavaScript is a prototype-based OOP language where objects can be created and extended using constructor functions, classes, and interfaces.

## Error handling:
C uses the "errno" variable to capture errors, while in JavaScript errors are thrown using the "throw" keyword and caught using the "try...catch" statement.

## Comments:
C uses // for single line comments and /* */ for multi-line comments, while in JavaScript // can be used for both single and multi-line comments.

## Strings:
In C, strings are represented as arrays of characters terminated by a null character '\0', while in JavaScript strings are primitive values that can be manipulated using string methods.

## Type coercion:
C has strict type checking and requires explicit casting between data types, while JavaScript has dynamic typing and automatically performs type coercion when necessary.

## Pointers:
C has support for pointers, which are variables that store memory addresses, while JavaScript does not have direct support for pointers but uses references to objects instead.

## Bitwise operators:
C has bitwise operators like &, |, ~, <<, and >> for working with binary data at the bit level, while JavaScript also has these operators but they are less commonly used.

## Switch statements:
In C, switch statements are often used for multiple branching based on a variable value, while in JavaScript switch statements can also work with strings and objects.

## Constants:
C uses the "const" keyword to define constants that cannot be changed after initialization, while in JavaScript "const" is also used for the same purpose but additionally supports block-level scoping.

## Null and undefined:
In C, null and undefined do not exist as specific data types, while in JavaScript they are used to represent the absence or nonexistence of a value.

## Loops:
C has several loop constructs including for, while, and do-while loops, while JavaScript also has these loops but also includes the "for...in" and "for...of" loops for iterating over object properties and iterable objects respectively.

## Operator precedence:
The operator precedence rules in C are different from those in JavaScript, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the rules are not understood.

## Math functions:
C has a limited set of math functions like sin, cos, sqrt, and pow, while JavaScript has a larger set of built-in math functions as well as support for the Math object.

## Conditional statements:
In C, conditional statements like if-else and switch require parentheses around the condition, while in JavaScript these parentheses are optional.

## Variable scope:
C has block-level scoping for variables declared with the "auto" keyword, while in JavaScript variable scope is determined by function-level scoping or block-level scoping when using let or const.

## Function overloading:
C supports function overloading, which allows multiple functions to have the same name but different parameter types, while JavaScript does not support function overloading.

## Type checking:
C has a built-in type checking function called "sizeof", which returns the size of a data type in bytes, while in JavaScript there is no equivalent function.

## Operator associativity:
The operator associativity rules in C and JavaScript are different, which can affect the order in which operations are performed if multiple operators of the same precedence are used in the same expression.

## Scope resolution:
In C, scope resolution is denoted using double colons "::", while in JavaScript this is not necessary as scope is determined by lexical nesting.

## Memory allocation:
C has direct control over memory allocation through functions like malloc and free, while in JavaScript memory allocation is handled automatically by the garbage collector.

## Header files:
C uses header files to define external functions and libraries that can be included in source code, while in JavaScript external libraries are usually included via modules or script tags.

## Type inference:
C requires explicit type declarations for variables and function parameters, while in JavaScript type inference is used to determine the data type based on the assigned value.
